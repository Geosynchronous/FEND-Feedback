- **Note 1**
- Cameron, thanks for the opportunity to email chat with you.
	- Since there is a lot I want to chat about, I will have my notes accessable in one place on a repo.  Our actual email conversations will be private, and I will only post my feedback in it: [FEND-Feedback/Notes_to_Pittman](https://github.com/Geosynchronous/FEND-Feedback/blob/master/Notes_to_Pittman.md)
		- currently, there are two sections:
			- OUTLINE
				- Structure to be updated and revised as needed
				- This first pass is just off the top of my head, it is not all inclusive
			- NOTES
				- New Notes sequentially numbered and added as needed
				- Form the basis of my email feedback to you as it occurs
- Click the above link to see the OUTLINE and this NOTE.
- Cheers, Geo

- **Note 2**
- Cameron, I really like the new platform engine
	- Much more responsive, information and link organization better, better UI overall
	- Three major things I would like to see added:
		- **Search Capability** 
			- Search entire FEND Nanodegree Course	
			- (or at least an index of all links that I can search)
			- (or an index vocabulary/terminology list that is hopefully searchable)
		- **Power User Thread**
			- Get non-essential course materail out of the way of student learning
			- Under RESOURCES Menu have access to all this material
			- As new cool non-essential material comes up in course, it can be briefly mentioned in Video and/or Student Notes
			- Make it clear that it is non-essential to completing the course
			- This will help beginners focus better on the CORE Learning Issues, and speed up progress through the course
			- This will allow all students to access this information when they are ready
		- **More Timely Updates of Student Notes**
			- Re-doing the course videos is understandably an expensive undertaking
			- Updating the STUDENT NOTES is not that expensive, and can really keep students  and Udacity support, coaching and mentoring from wasting their time
			- Things that require timely updates
				- Deprecated Code
				- Newer Versions (Chrome Dev Tools)
				- Anything that comes up in Udacity Discussion Forum as a problem with the course
				- Missing instructions
			- A better internal pipeline for responding to these issues
			- Training students to use Forums more effectively, so that this needed feedback flwos better
	- I will be glad to respond and clarify anything here if needed, may well talk about it in more detail later in these notes too. 
- Cheers, Geo
